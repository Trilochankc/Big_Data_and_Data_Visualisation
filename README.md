Machine learning Models (Train,Test) (0.7,0.3)
The dataset is divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets using the randomSplit method. The seed guarantees repeatability. The training set ratio is then computed and printed to validate the split.

Linear Regression
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1132.11
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 1281679.92
R-Squared (r2): 0.92

Polynomial Regression
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 972.35
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 945476.70
R-Squared (r2): 0.94

These metrics indicate that the polynomial regression model has a strong predictive power with a high R-squared value, explaining over 92% of the variance in diamond prices. However, the RMSE and MSE values suggest there is still some error in the predictions.
